# ABET Constraints Essay

### Economic
Based on the current standing of our project, there are some financial limitations to our solution. We do not have a formal budget outlined, but we have hardware requirements that must be met. These include the access points, central server, and client devices used for testing which are detailed in our design diagrams. Funds for the hardware are being supplied personally by team members at the moment. However, our solution is very similar to a proposal outlined by Northrop Grumman Corporation, so we may reach out to the contact listed to see if we can secure funds. Because of this cost, we've designed our solution to use only custom built or open source software to keep the software development costs low. We plan on setting up a network in our own homes to test the solution, but we may seek permission to utilize UC networks to test on a larger scale.

### Legal
Legally, our project could possibly run into issues. Looking at our user stories, we do not foresee any issues arising from the IT specialist or warehouse manager scenarios. This is because they deal with private or enterprise use cases and the users would have a right to know the information we (they) will be gathering on devices. The conference planner scenario on the other hand could be diving into some gray area because it deals more with public networks. In the U.S., this form of location tracking might not be strictly illegal but we could foresee individuals taking issue with it all the same. Outside of the U.S., European privacy laws (GDPR) are extremely strict, so any form of personally identifiable information gathered could violate these policies.


### Security
Are there security concerns with your project? Are potential viruses or eavesdropping an issue? Are there privacy concerns?

### Social
Will your project be used for public service? Will it be used by a non-profit agency? Does it have some benefit for society? Does it enhance peopleâ€™s lives or quality of life in some way?
