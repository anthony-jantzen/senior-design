# ABET Constraints Essay

### Economic
Based on the current standing of our project, there are some financial limitations to our solution. We do not have a formal budget outlined, but we have hardware requirements that must be met. These include the access points, central server, and client devices used for testing which are detailed in our design diagrams. Funds for the hardware are being supplied personally by team members at the moment. However, our solution is very similar to a proposal outlined by Northrop Grumman Corporation, so we may reach out to the contact listed to see if we can secure funds. Because of this cost, we've designed our solution to use only custom built or open source software to keep the software development costs low. We plan on setting up a network in our own homes to test the solution, but we may seek permission to utilize UC networks to test on a larger scale.
