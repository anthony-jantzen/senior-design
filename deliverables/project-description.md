## Abstract
Obtaining physical locations of devices is becoming essential with the massive quantity of internet connected machines. GPS is frequently used for obtaining device location, but itâ€™s battery expensive and not accurate indoors. Argus allows a network administrator to monitor the locations of devices connected to, or nearby, a mesh network. Using a combination of signal strength information obtained from intercepting packets sent over a wireless mesh network, the goal of Argus is to display relative locations of devices with a resolution of up to 3 meters.

## Background Description
A tool that allows a central node to measure distance between multiple WiFi emitters. This tool will use a combination of RSSI based distance measurements and calculations to estimate target locations and present them as a heatmap. 

## Problem Statement
This application will allow for indoor location tracking where GPS is not reliable. This application also provides a cross-platform user interface.

## Inadequacy of Current Solutions
Current solutions fail to meet our cost and feature requirements. Many are not open source and cost money to use. Additionally, most solutions lack the heatmap conglomeration of devices and take too long to estimate locations.

## Background Skills/Interests
Our team overall has a general interest in networking and security, with three out of the four members possessing a background in security already. In addition, most if not all team members have some experience in web development and UI design, peaking the interests of those more inclined to application development and design. Above all else, this project looks to be a challenging task that will no doubt result in a very useful final product.

## Goals
* A listing of devices on a network including MAC address, hostname, and manufacturer
* For each device, it's approximate location listed, as well as a visual rendering
* Live cross-platform interface with location mapping
* Location accuracy within 3 meters

## Expectations
Ideally, our team aims to fulfill the goals above and any additional requirements added along the way. A hands on demo targeting the visual rendering of a device's location and information will be essential to our development and planning.
