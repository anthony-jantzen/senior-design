## Background Description
A tool that allows a central node to measure distance between multiple WiFi emitters. This tool will use a hybrid of RSSI and time of flight based distance measurements to estimate target locations. 

## Problem Statement
This application will allow for indoor location tracking where GPS is not reliable. This application also provides a cross-platform user interface. 

## Inadequacy of Current Solutions
Current solutions use signal strength information (RSSI) which requires pre-known information on wireless access points in order to triangulate location. RSSI based distance measurements are also not as accurate as time of flight based distance calculations which is hybridized in this project.

## Background Skills/Interests
Our team overall has a general interest in networking and security, with three out of the four members possessing a background in security already. In addition, most if not all team members have some experience in web development and UI design, peaking the interests of those more inclined to application development and design. Above all else, this project looks to be a challenging task that will no doubt result in a very useful final product.

## Goals
* A listing of devices on a network including MAC address, hostname, and manufacturer
* For each device, it's approximate location listed, as well as a visual rendering
* Cross-platform interface
* Live data on the client side

## Expectations
Ideally, our team aims to fulfill the goals above and any additional requirements added along the way. A hands on demo targeting the visual rendering of a device's location and information will be essential to our development and planning.
