# Self-Assessment Essay - Kyle Trout
As I am the most experienced web developer, the team put me in charge of the User experience. In the past, I had used Preact as a framework that provides a fast and lightweight API for creating front ends that is comparable to React. While I wanted to make use of this framework, I needed to be positive that it appropriately fit the projects needs in terms of a web application. This required me to communicate with the other team members to properly identify the key expectations for this user interface. 

One of the major obstacles I ran into while development was a lack of test data. We spent a significat amount of time trying to optimize the output from the packet processing module for ease of use in the front end. We wanted to do this in such a way that future versions of argus can be easily extended upon via an API. However, without test output data from the packet processing, it was difficult to speculate how to develop the front end to utalize said data. Once I did get a sample of what the packet processor module would output, I was easily able to format it in such a way that the front end of Argus was able to create a dynamic heatmap based on the data processed in the back end.
