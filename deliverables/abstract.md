## Abstract

Obtaining physical locations of devices is becoming essential with the massive quantity of internet connected machines. GPS is frequently used for obtaining device location, but itâ€™s battery expensive and not accurate indoors. Argus allows a network administrator to monitor the locations of devices connected to, or nearby, a mesh network. Using a combination of signal strength and Time of Flight information obtained from intercepting packets sent over a wireless mesh network, the goal of Argus is to display relative locations of devices with a resolution of up to 2 meters.
