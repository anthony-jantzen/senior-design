## Project Sought
Nothing specific immediately jumps out at me. I think something to do with healthcare or security sounds interesting. I don't claim to be a full stack developer, but I have a decent amount of experience in most stages of full stack development. Ideally, I would love a project that encompasses all of them. In addition, containerization and continuous integration sound really awesome and useful to me, so I would be very interested in projects that incorporate one or both of these ideas.
