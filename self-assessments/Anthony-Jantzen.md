# Self-Assessment Essay for Anthony Jantzen

My team's project for senior design is a network management helper. We will be building a desktop and mobile application designed to help individuals manage the devices on their network. The core functionality of the tool will allow individuals to trust or deny devices connected to or attempting to connect to their network. All of this will be done through a simple and sleek user interface. Our motivation behind this tool stems from the cost and complexities associated with similar tools on the market currently. The overall goal is to reach individuals who may not be savvy with technology or networking and provide them with a tool that makes it easy to enhance the security of their network.
