## Background Description
A desktop and mobile application tool that allows for simple management of devices connected to a wireless network. The tool will enable the user to configure settings to allow for trustworthy devices and blacklist those which are not.

## Problem Statement
Our team wants a tool to simply manage devices on a wireless network, allowing for full transparency. Any lack of transparency puts users/administrators in the dark on their home network, paving the way for untrusted individuals to perform intrusions and malicious activities.

## Inadequacy of Current Network Mangement Solutions
### Netspot
* Costs money - Not open source
* Limits usage per cost tier
* Focuses gathering data on multiple networks rather hardening local network
* Usage is not as feature rich on Windows as Mac

### LogicMonitor
* Costs money
* Usage is focused toward corporations, not home use

### PRTG Network Monitor
* Costs Money
* Monitors More than just local Networks - can be overwhelming for inexperienced users

### GFI Languard
* Costs Money

### OpenNMS
* Too feature rich and not usable for inexperienced users
* Doesn't integrate with router?

### WifiDog
* Doesn't have android/mobile alert integration

### PacketFense
* Doesn't have android/mobile alert integration

## Background Skills/Interests
Our team overall has a general interest in networking and security, with three out of the four members possessing a background in security already. In addition, most if not all team members have some experience in web development and UI design, peaking the interests of those more inclined to application development and design. Above all else, this project looks to be a challenging task that will no doubt result in a very useful final product.

## Approach
Our proposed solution is to design a desktop and mobile application that will provide a clear view of devices connected to a network with configurable settings and access management. More details follow in our goals and expectations:

#### Goals
* Simple listing of devices on network or attempting to connect, including MAC address, name, and manufacturer
* Configurable settings to permanently store personal or trusted devices
* Alertable prompt to trust or blacklist devices attempting to connect to network
* Sleek, easy-to-use interface for applications
* OpenWRT integration for ubiquity to all router
* Temporary access grants for guest devices that expires on user-configured settings

#### Expectations
